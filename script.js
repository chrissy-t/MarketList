/*A small business wishes to display a bill for its customers on a web page.
 Design a web page which includes three items along with their prices.
 The bill should include the sub-total, VAT and total charge.
As it is the holiday season, the business also wishes to include a 5% discount on the sub-total.
Each itemâ€™s price, the VAT, the discount and the total should have unique IDs for their respective HTML element.
 Write JavaScript which will read the prices from the webpage and store the sum in a sub-total variable.
 Calculate the discount, VAT and total charge and store in separate variables. Update the web page with the calculated values*/
